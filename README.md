# AlpakitSO
1. Copy the `Engine` inside your UE root installation or, alternatively, manually copy the `PackagePlugin.cs` where it needs to be as per repo structure.
2. Re-build `AutomationScripts.Automation.csproj` (even if you have Launcher UE build - all .Net tools come with source)
3. See provided BAT file on how to package the mod manually.
4. Alternatively, build Alpakit plugin
